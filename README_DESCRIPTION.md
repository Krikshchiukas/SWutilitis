#This college project was to design and build a web application by using PHP to connect the front-end to database.


This project was to create 5 pages ecommerce web application that can be connected to a database using PHP.
We were given free rein on the subject of the web application to design and develop using HTML, CSS, PHP and mySQL.
I decided on creating a web app for South West Utilities TV shop. I adapted a Bootstrap template and edited the HTML/CSS code and
added the PHP into the code. On the first page I created slideshow by using jQuery with TVâ€™s images and hot deals.
Also, there is the list of products (which is coming from database) by click on which it is opening page with description of a product.
After that I have created FAQ page. For this page I was using jQuery to show/hide answer on a question. 
On CONTACT page contact form is validated by PHP and data is saving to the database. Product can be added to the cart from home page
or from detailed description of product. In the cart a costumer can change quantity, delete item and see subtotal.
